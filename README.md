# JetsProject

# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jacob Stuart
### Programming student with Skill Distillery

- Iâ€™m currently working on [JetsProject](https://github.com/VulcanMindForge/JetsProject)

- Iâ€™m currently learning **Java**

- All of my projects are available at [https://github.com/VulcanMindForge](https://github.com/VulcanMindForge)

# Description of this project
Alternatives allowed in place of Jets. This program will use a fleet of Airships. Information about the airships can be pulled, methods called, and ships created or removed. 

# How to use this project
Still in development

# Technologies Used
Overall I am learning and using Eclipse IDE to program in Java 1.8. Prior to this assignment we covered: Variables and Constants, Methods, Screen Output and Keyboard Input, Expressions, If/Else, Switch, While loops, For Loops, Cast Numerals, Packages, Stringbuilder, Objects, Classes, Superclasses, JUnit testing, TDD or Testing Driven Developement, UML class diagrams, Encapsulation, Inheritance in Java, Visibility, ASCII and Unicode Data.

**New since last project:** Abstract classes, Primitive Wrapper Classes, Interfaces, ArrayLists, Lists, Sets, Exceptions, Exceptions with JUnit, Input/Output Streams, Garbage Collection, Debugging Programs Overview.

# Current Progress
Made initial UML and planned states and behaviors(Likely missed some)
Created all classes
Created method stubs, contructors, and overrides

# Next Steps
Add code for each of the 3 ship types.

Main:
Create menu and menu switch
File in method and create a second file for enemies
	remember to close down systems
	try with resources
	code out any errors that can be coded out
Add method for a dogfight
Create or borrow code for body of sorting fastest and longest range ships
Implement add and remove ship methods
Implement farewell method



# Lessons learned or reinforced on this project
Start getting in the habit of least privelage. Keep private what you can, it can be made public later if needed with less chance of causing issues with code.

Abstract methods, interfaces, and classes help to make code more organized and improve readability.

Airships are fun!
